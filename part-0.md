# Intro

Welcome to the Docker on Windows workshop :)

---

## Agenda

The workshop starts with an overview presentation. 

I'll talk about Docker and Windows containers, and tailor the content to the group - it can be a Docker 101 for folks new to containers, or a comparison of Windows and Linux containers for folks already comfortable with Docker on Linux.

## Connect to your VM 

You'll be given the connection details for your Windows Server 2016 VM.

- [Check your setup](./setup.md)

Then we'll work together through the tasks in the workshop.
