# docker-windows-workshop

Docker is a platform for running applications in lightweight units of compute called containers. The platform supports the full development and deployment lifcycle - with Docker you can build, ship and run any app anywhere.

Docker runs natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. In this workshop you'll use Windows Server 2016 and learn:

- how Windows Docker containers work
- how to package an existing .NET app using Docker
- how to modernize an ASP.NET WebForms app using Docker
- how Docker supports resilience and scale on a single server
- how to run a full CI pipeline using Docker
- how Docker swarm mode provides production-grade orchestration.

Tasks for the workshop are split into sections. 

> Start by making sure your environment is set up correctly

- [Check your setup](setup.md)

Then we'll follow along with these. For a morning workshop, we'll do Parts 1-3. For a full day workshop, we continue in the afternoon with parts 4-6.

> It doesn't matter if you're from a dev or an ops background, you'll learn how the Docker platform benefits all aspects of IT.

- [Part 1](part-1.md) - running Docker on Windows
- [Part 2](part-2.md) - packaging an existing ASP.NET app in Docker
- [Part 3](part-3.md) - modernizing the ASP.NET app with Docker

- [Part 4](part-5.md) - resilience and scalability with Docker Compose
- [Part 5](part-5.md) - containerized CI (and CD) with Docker
- [Part 6](part-6.md) - production-ready orchestration with Docker swarm mode
