# docker-windows-workshop

A 

Docker runs natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. In this workshop you will learn:

- how to package Windows applications as Docker images and run them as Docker containers
- how to build a Docker image from an MSI and then move away from MSIs
- how to extract features from a monolithic app and run them in containers

Tasks for the workshop are split into sections. 

> Start by making sure your environment is set up correctly

Then we'll follow along with these. For a morning workshop, we'll do Parts 1-3. For a full day workshop, we continue with parts 4-6.
